## About this project

GdiplusUI is a UI C++ component library developed based on Gdiplus, which runs only on Windows platform. It provides an out-of-the-box approach similar to ImgUI, which can implement complex UI logic with less code, although it is a bit cumbersome. It is not similar to WinForm, WinUI3 or Direct2D-based UI libraries, and its compiled size is small, so you don't have to worry about the overall project size being too large.
